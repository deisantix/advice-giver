This is a solution to the [Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/chanllenges/-advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db).

## Overview

### The challenge
Users should be able to:

- Get a random advice everytime the page loads;
- Get a random advice everytime the dice button is clicked;
- Get a simple animation of the dice rolling everytime is clicked;

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Didn't try to use anything new in the project since I was aiming in practice what I already new, but definetly learned a bit about manipulating CSS animations with JavaScript
